# Project outcomes? (300 Words)

<!-- Describe what information or knowledge you expect to generate from the project.
Include any non-written deliverables such as codes, exhibitions, etc -->

## The Server

The major outcome would be the piece of software,
a generic academic forum web server.

It should come in the form of a set of auxiliary libraries
and a monolithic web server,
all under the MIT license.
All the parts should be well-documented and provide clear APIs.

## A LiveView Experiment

Phoenix LiveView is a relatively new concept,
so testing out whether it works well for building a forum is a good reference
for how mature it is.

## System Design Experience

During the design and development of the server,
we should generate experience for system design.
The server will have complex logic so it is natural to share a lot of
information across it.
However, for it to be customizable and extensible,
it needs to make sure that the data are not mangled and clear lines can be
drawn to separate different parts of it.

## Public Testing

Once the server is developed well enough to have a usable interface,
we can launch it for public testing.
The testing will allow us to sense the immediate problem we have and improve
upon it,
while demonstrating the features of the forum web server and the openness of
its development.
