## Forum Web Server

A server is a piece of software that can serves information to its clients,
which themselves are also software.
A web server is a server that communicates with its clients via web
communication protocols.
Among these protocols,
the most notable two are the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) and its version
2 (HTTP2).

Web servers can support any client that implements the corresponding protocol,
but the most popular clients are web browsers.
Web browsers empowers the users to access web applications,
services provided by connecting users' browsers to specific web servers,
without having any knowledge of the programming behavior of any server.

A forum web server serves a web application called a web forum.
In a web forum,
users can create *posts* on particular topics and *comments* in response to
other people's posts and comments.
Posts and comments are usually publicly visible among a group of users,
but such their visibility can also be tuned as needed.
These contents can be edited, hidden, or deleted by the author or moderators.

Besides satisfying these fundamentals above,
the server should meet the following requirements.

## Maintainability and Extendability

## User Experience

## Server Performance
